## Issues Fixed This Session

### 1. Text/Button Overlap
**Location:** ReturnVisitorHero.tsx, NewVisitorHero
**Problem:** Partner link used `absolute bottom-8` positioning
**Fix:** Changed to `mt-16` in content flow
**Commit:** 4117c8e

### 2. Missing Wrapper Div
**Location:** NewVisitorHero component
**Problem:** Content not wrapped in `max-w-2xl` container
**Fix:** Added proper wrapper div structure
**Commit:** 4117c8e

### 3. Heading Font Weights
**Location:** All components with h1/h2/h3
**Problem:** Using `font-bold` (700) instead of `font-medium` (500)
**Fix:** Changed all headings to `font-medium` per brand spec
**Commit:** 8d125d9

## Known Limitations

1. **Graphik Font Not Loading**
   - Font files not present in `/public/fonts/`
   - Currently falling back to Inter (clean fallback)
   - Action: Client to provide licensed Graphik Trial files

2. **firstName in Results URL**
   - SSR shows "there" as default before client hydration
   - Works correctly when coming through quiz flow
   - Minor UX issue for direct URL access

---

## Lessons Learned (Committed to Memory)

1. **Always check font file presence** — Don't just define @font-face without verifying files exist
2. **Avoid absolute positioning for content** — Use margin/padding for content flow to prevent overlaps
3. **Match brand spec exactly** — font-bold (700) ≠ font-medium (500), verify against spec
4. **Self-QA before delivery** — Visual browser review catches issues copy audits miss
5. **Document brand colors in CSS variables** — Makes verification easy

## Final Score Assessment

| Criteria | Before | After |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Padding/Spacing | 5 | 8 |
| Layout/Overlap | 4 | 9 |
| Typography | 5 | 8 |
| Colors | 9 | 9 |
| **Overall** | **5-6** | **8** |

*Note: To reach 9, need Graphik font files loaded*
